[04/10/2023, 20:46:43] Shaikh Shoaib DSBA: Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening maam,
We, the Students of fy msc data science wanted to have a discussion with you regarding our bridge course exams but due to your busy schedule we couldn't. Hence, we are presenting this message to you regarding the issue.

During our bridge course and even in syllabus it was mentioned that we wont be having maths exam but only statistics. The maths bridge course portion was also skipped and we started with our fy syllabus portion for it. Hence it caused a confusion among us Students about the said exam. If you would be please kind enough to clear our confusion by letting us know whether we have to give this exam or not, we would be thankful.
[04/10/2023, 20:47:12] Shaikh Shoaib DSBA: This will be the letter we'll be sending to maam regarding the maths exam in bridge course if she doesn't discuss tomorrow as well
[04/10/2023, 20:47:31] Shaikh Shoaib DSBA: Give your suggestion and react with 👍 if you support the above mentioned topic
[04/10/2023, 20:48:40] Shaikh Shoaib DSBA: This is not the only issue we wanted to discuss with maam, we also wanted to discuss about proper faculties, proper lectures and lecs of cyber security with her but if we mention everything together, probably she wont be able to co operate
[04/10/2023, 20:48:50] Shaikh Shoaib DSBA: So we'll start with this, since the exam deadline is near

[18/10/2023, 14:21:50] Shaikh Shoaib DSBA: *Some important guidelines we should follow*
1 - Guys if we are having any discussion or announcement in our class please remember it is an announcement for Msc only and doesnt necessarily concern with bsc. So please don't go around and spread misinformation.
 2 - Whenever you have some doubts or issues it is always better to first discuss it in this unofficial group before going directly to the faculty or official chat. Sometime what we want to say can get lost in translation because of our choice of words and can create trouble for others
3- If we have any issue related to a certain subject make sure we mention it in our complaint so other subjects don't get the hit unnecessary
4- Dont share any unnecessary information until we recieve it from the concerned officials because it can create confusion among ourselves. Make sure whatever you share is authentic and doesnt trouble others.
[18/10/2023, 14:22:05] Aakash Msc: Noted that!
