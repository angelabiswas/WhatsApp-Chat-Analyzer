We, the Students of fy msc data science wanted to have a discussion with you regarding our bridge course exams but due to your busy schedule we couldn't. Hence, we are presenting this message to you regarding the issue.

During our bridge course and even in syllabus it was mentioned that we wont be having maths exam but only statistics. The maths bridge course portion was also skipped and we started with our fy syllabus portion for it. Hence it caused a confusion among us Students about the said exam. We humbly request your good selves to  clear our confusion by letting us know about the maths bridge course exam.

Thank you.

[26/10/2023, 23:04:31] Shaikh Shoaib DSBA: Maam actually due to the current mega block in western line students who travel from that line are facing issues. A notice was released that 260 trains are cancelled for tomorrow and hence there will only be a limited number of trains for commute. Due to the rush and delays of trains the students are concerned about coming to college as it might not be possible for many of them, and even commute in evening will be tough for them to go back home. These series of mega block will be continuous from 25th oct to 4th nov.
[27/10/2023, 06:41:39] Shaileja Kc: But I can't cancel lectures for so many days.

[20/12/2023, 22:19:03] ~ Aditi Sharma: Hello ma’am @918169881570 I would just want to say that after a 4 hour workshop, having 3 lectures is difficult with respect to actually concentrating
[20/12/2023, 22:19:32] Adnan Msc: +1
[20/12/2023, 22:20:01] Aakash Msc: +1
[20/12/2023, 22:21:00] Shaikh Shoaib DSBA: Since the seminar is in morning, us who come from far will have to leave early too. Sitting in lec after seminar would be a issue as well. The online lec is from 4 but we wont be able to attend it properly since many would still be in train
[20/12/2023, 22:21:27] ~ Waseem: +1
[20/12/2023, 22:21:29] ~ Aditi Sharma: If we suggest we may start online lectures after we resume from workshop and reach home.
[20/12/2023, 22:21:34] ~ Aditi Sharma: It should be more convenient
[20/12/2023, 22:21:47] ~ Shweta Maitri: Sorry for the inconvenience Please note the change in the timetable.
[20/12/2023, 22:29:45] Shaileja Kc: We don't mind cancelling all lectures but don't complain if the syllabus is not complete. Now you all are grown ups. You  need to sit for a full day someday.  I am actually surprised to read such reasons.
[20/12/2023, 22:30:19] Shaileja Kc: Shweta please cancel all lectures and they will do the remaining syllabus on their own.
[20/12/2023, 22:31:48] ~ Shweta Maitri: Okk ma'am
[20/12/2023, 22:39:28] Shaikh Shoaib DSBA: Please don’t cancel the lectures ma'am, we’ll manage as much possible by us with travelling & concentration ‎<This message was edited>
[20/12/2023, 22:42:01] Shaileja Kc: Understand shoaib, we go out off our way to make things better for you all ,but there is no gratitude. One day you all are not ready to stay back for your sake. Nothing is for our benefit. I don't want you all to get bad marks.
[20/12/2023, 22:43:22] ~ Aditi Sharma: Ma’am we understand and we are grateful just putting out our point of view & issue
To reach at 8 we’ve to leave 6-6:30 then if we leave at 2 almost its 4 reaching home then sitting the lecture again. It’s not just to attend name sake right
[20/12/2023, 22:43:33] Shaikh Shoaib DSBA: Yes we understand it ma'am, the faculty is for us only. It was just a concern because we had online lec after offline and it wont be possible for many of us to reach home in an hour so thats why we asked About it.
